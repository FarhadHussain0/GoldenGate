			<p>Visiting the world famous Golden Gate Bridge is a unique experience for everyone. Whether you hike, walk, bike, shop, take a guided tour, or just sit back and take it all in, there is something for everyone. The Bridge's Welcome Center offers merchandise and historical information. Open daily from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., the Welcome Center is the first on-site center dedicated to telling the stories of the Golden Gate Bridge. Learn about the history, science, and engineering of the Bridge's construction through interactive and stationery exhibits. Wander through the Plaza just outside the Welcome Center and follow the pathway into an old bunker that houses some of the exhibits. If you're interested in the history of the Golden Gate Bridge, twice-weekly (Thursdays and Sundays) free walking Bridge tours are offered by San Francisco City Guides. The Round House is now Equator Coffee. Enjoy a steaming cup of coffee with beautiful views! Both ends of the Bridge touch the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Enjoy picturesque trails and vista points in one of the worldâ€™s largest national parks in an urban area. </p>
